exframe v3.1
Copyright 2011-2019 Niklas Beisert

exframe is a LaTeX2e package which provides a general purpose
framework to describe and typeset exercises and exam questions
along with their solutions. The package features mechanisms to
hide or postpone solutions, to assign and handle points, to
collect problems on exercise sheets, to store and use metadata
and to implement a consistent numbering. It also provides a
very flexible interface for configuring and customising the
formatting, layout and representation of the exercise content.

    README.txt   readme file
    exframe.ins  installation file
    exframe.dtx  source file
    exframe.sty  package file
