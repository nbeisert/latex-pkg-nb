collref is a LaTeX2e package to automatically collect 
multiple \bibitem references which always appear in the same sequence 
in \cite into a single \bibitem block.

The package consists of the files 

    \texttt{README}      & readme file \\
    \texttt{collref.ins} & installation file \\
    \texttt{collref.dtx} & source file \\
    \texttt{collref.sty} & package file \\
    \texttt{collsamp.tex}& sample file \\
    \texttt{collref.pdf} & manual 

The distribution consists of the files README, collref.ins and collref.dtx.

Run "(pdf)latex collref.dtx" to compile the manual collref.pdf.

Run "tex collref.ins" to create the package collref.sty and the sample collsamp.tex.
Copy the file collref.sty to an appropriate directory of your LaTeX
distribution, e.g. texmf-root/tex/latex/collref.
