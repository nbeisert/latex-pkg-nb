\begin{abstract}\noindent
\textsf{collref} is a \LaTeXe{} package to automatically collect
multiple |\bibitem| references which always appear in the same sequence
in |\cite| into a single |\bibitem| block.

\section{Introduction}

Suppose a manuscript uses the following set of four references:
%
\begin{thebib}
\item Reference A
\item Reference B
\item Reference C
\item Reference D
\end{thebib}
%
Now if references B and C cover similar or related material,
they might always be cited together as in ``[\ldots, 2, 3, \ldots]''
throughout the manuscript.
In some (physics) journals it is then customary to collect the two
references into a single reference
%
\begin{thebib}
\item Reference A
\item Reference B
\par Reference C
\item Reference D
\end{thebib}
%
and cite it by ``[\ldots, 2, \ldots]''.
The package \textsf{collref} automates this process
by analysing the |\cite| commands
and identifying blocks of references
which always appear in conjunction.
These blocks are collapsed to a single item
in the bibliography.
Please note that \textsf{collref} requires the sequence
of |\bibitem| entries to match with
the sequence of |\cite| blocks.
This is most easily achieved through the use of \BibTeX{}
with any \emph{unsorted} style.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Similar CTAN Packages.}

The objective and some of the implementation
of the \textsf{collref} package is similar to the
CTAN packages \href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mcite/}{\textsf{mcite}} by Thorsten Ohl
and \href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mciteplus/}{\textsf{mciteplus}} by Michael Shell,
but the functionality is different is several respects:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
\textsf{collref} is intended to work transparently:
\LaTeX{} documents which compile with \textsf{collref}
should also compile fine without invoking \textsf{collref}
(obviously without collected references).
The package decides automatically which references
can be collapsed,
no further interaction of the author is required.

\textsf{mcite} and \textsf{mciteplus} leave the
decision/duty to collapse certain references
using the modified syntax |\cite{A,*B,*C}|.

\item
\textsf{mcite} and \textsf{mciteplus} are intended to handle punctuations
in collapsed references correctly.
This requires a specialised \BibTeX{} style.

No effort is made in \textsf{collref} in this regard.
Some minor modification in \texttt{collref.sty}
together with a modified \BibTeX{} style
might achieve basic punctuation features similar to \textsf{mcite}.
\end{itemize}
%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Usage}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Inclusion.}

To use \textsf{collref} simply add the command
\begin{center}|\usepackage{collref}|\end{center}
to the preamble of your \LaTeX{} document.
No further interaction is required.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Punctuation.}

\textsf{collref} provide basic punctuation between collected references.
This is specified through the package options
|\usepackage[|\textit{opt}|]{collref}|
where \textit{opt} is one of the following
\par\vspace{2ex}\noindent%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.24\linewidth}
\centerline{\texttt{nosep} (default)}\par\vspace{1ex}
no separator:
\begin{thebib}
\item A
\item B C
\item D
\end{thebib}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.24\linewidth}
\centerline{\texttt{parsep}}\par\vspace{1ex}
separated by |\par|:
\begin{thebib}
\item A
\item B
\par C
\item D
\end{thebib}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.24\linewidth}
\centerline{\texttt{bulletsep}}\par\vspace{1ex}
separated by `\textbullet':
\begin{thebib}
\item A
\item B \textbullet{} C
\item D
\end{thebib}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.28\linewidth}
\centerline{\texttt{punctsep}}\par\vspace{1ex}
punctuated by `;' and '.':
\begin{thebib}
\item A .
\item B ; C .
\item D .
\end{thebib}
cf.\ note on spacing below.
\end{minipage}%
\par\vspace{2ex}\noindent
%
Alternative separators can be specified in the preamble through the
command:
\begin{center}
|\collectsep[|\textit{punctuation}|]{|\textit{separator}|}|
\end{center}
The \textit{separator} appears between references in a block and
the \textit{punctuation} at the end of a block of references.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Bibliography Preparation.}

Please note that only such blocks of references can be collapsed
which appear in the same order for
|\cite| commands as for |thebibliography|.
It is recommended to prepare the bibliography through \BibTeX{}
which does this automatically.
You must use a style which does not sort the references
but preserves the order in which they were |\cite|'d,
e.g.\ \texttt{unsrt.bst}.

Also note that \textsf{collref} suppresses
new paragraphs invoked by empty lines in the bibliography.
This allows to use standard \BibTeX{} styles
which commonly separate reference entries by empty lines.
If these empty lines would be expanded to new paragraphs,
\textsf{collref} would not be able to join two references properly.
Therefore new paragraphs have to be invoked by the
command |\par|.

If you wish to use the style \texttt{punctsep}, please
refer to the following note on spacing and punctuation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Spacing and Punctuation.}

References are usually punctuated in some way.
Three of the predefined styles --
\texttt{nosep}, \texttt{parsep} and \texttt{bulletsep} --
preserve the punctuation from the bibliography.

The fourth predefined style -- \texttt{punctsep} --
automatically performs the punctuation.
This however requires care in the preparation
of the bibliography:
The entries have to be provided \emph{without} punctuation.
Furthermore, there must not be \emph{whitespaces} at the
end of an entry.
They can be suppressed with `|%|'
or |\ignorespaces|
directly following the last word of the entry.
See Appendix \ref{sec:sample} for an example.
The standard \BibTeX{} styles, e.g.\ \texttt{unsrt.bst},
have to be adjusted to remove the punctuation and whitespaces.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Control.}


The package \textsf{collref} provides one command to control
which references (not) to collect:
%
\begin{center}
|\nocollect{|\textit{label}|}|
\end{center}
%
It ensures that the label \textit{label} starts
a new block of references.
It is not collapsed with earlier references.
Later references, however, can still be collapsed
to the end of \textit{label}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Labels for Blocks of References.}

While \textsf{collref} aims to automatically
collect similar references into a single block, it is often
convenient for the author to refer to such blocks
with a single citation label.
Standard \TeX/\LaTeX{} commands can be used to define such a block:
\begin{center}
|\newcommand{|\textit{$\backslash$blocklabel}|}{|\textit{label1, label2, \ldots}|}|
\end{center}
Subsequently this block can be referenced with
|\cite{|\textit{\ldots, $\backslash$blocklabel, \ldots}|}|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Interaction with CTAN Packages.}

The package \textsf{collref} has been tested with other
CTAN packages concerned with citations and the bibliography:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item\textsf{cite}:
\textsf{collref} works in conjunction with \textsf{cite}.
Note that you must load \textsf{cite} \emph{before} \textsf{collref}
so that the latter can pass the correctly reduced list of
references down to \textsf{cite}.
Tested with v5.1 and v5.3 (2010/09/10).

\item
\textsf{hyperref}:
\textsf{collref} works in conjunction with \textsf{hyperref}.
The two packages can be loaded in any sequence.
Tested with v6.78s and v6.83m (2012/11/06).

\end{itemize}

% \section{Implementation}
%\iffalse
%<*package>
%\fi
%
% In this section we describe the package |collref.sty|.
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \paragraph{Internal Lists.}
%
% For each bibliography label \textit{label} the package
% maintains a predecessor |\nc@p@|\textit{label}
% and a successor |\nc@s@|\textit{label}.
% These are initially undefined.
% When a label \textit{label} is first cited these labels
% are set to the \textit{predecessor} and \textit{successor} labels, respectively,
% in |\cite{|\textit{\ldots, predecessor, label, successor, \ldots}|}|.
% An empty |\nc@p@|\textit{label} or |\nc@s@|\textit{label}
% refers to the beginning and end of a block, respectively.
% Whenever |\cite| finds conflicting blocks
% (non-matching predecessors or successors in two |\cite|'s),
% it terminates the blocks to the maximum common overlap.
%
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \paragraph{Interface.}
%
% The package provides two public commands, described above:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\collectsep}[2][]{\def\nc@punct{#1}\def\nc@sep{#2}}
\newcommand{\nocollect}[1]{\nc@breakbefore{#1}\ignorespaces}
%    \end{macrocode}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \paragraph{Package Options.}
%
% The package provides four predefined separators described above:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareOption{nosep}{\collectsep{}}
\DeclareOption{parsep}{\collectsep{\par}}
\DeclareOption{bulletsep}{\collectsep{\textbullet{} }}
\DeclareOption{punctsep}{\collectsep[.]{; }}
\ExecuteOptions{nosep}
\ProcessOptions

\newcommand{\nc@getcsname}[1]{\csname #1\endcsname}
\newcommand{\nc@setcsname}[2]{\expandafter\xdef\csname #1\endcsname{#2}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Command to terminate the chain before a label:
% The predecessor of the label is terminated.
% If the predecessor was active, its successor is also terminated.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\nc@breakbefore}[1]{%
  \edef\nc@citepred{\@ifundefined{nc@p@#1}{}{\nc@getcsname{nc@p@#1}}}%
  \ifx\nc@citepred\@empty\else\nc@setcsname{nc@s@\nc@citepred}{}\fi%
  \nc@setcsname{nc@p@#1}{}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Command to terminate the chain after a label. Similar to the above command.
%    \begin{macrocode}
