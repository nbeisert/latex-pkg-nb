eqnlines is a LaTeX2e package providing a framework for typesetting
single- and multi-line equations which extends the established
equation environments of LaTeX and the amsmath package with many
options for convenient adjustment of the intended layout. In
particular, the package adds flexible schemes for numbering,
horizontal alignment and semi-automatic punctuation, and it improves
upon the horizontal and vertical spacing options. The extensions can
be used and adjusted through optional arguments and modifiers to the
equation environments as well as global settings.

The package consists of the files

    README.txt        readme file
    eqnlines.ins      installation file
    eqnlines.dtx      source file
    eqnlines.sty      package file
    eqnlines-dev.sty  package file (development version)

The distribution consists of the files
README.txt, eqnlines.ins and eqnlines.dtx.

Run "(pdf)latex eqnlines.dtx" to compile the manual eqnlines.pdf.

Run "latex eqnlines.ins" to create the package eqnlines.sty and the
development version eqnlines-dev.sty.
Copy the file eqnlines.sty to an appropriate directory of your LaTeX
distribution, e.g. texmf-root/tex/latex/eqnlines.
