\begin{abstract}\noindent
\markpkg{mpostinl} is a \LaTeXe{} package
which enables the embedding of \MP{} figures
within a \LaTeX{} document.
The package automatically collects the embedded
definitions and figures in a |.mp| file,
adds an appropriate \LaTeX{} document structure,
and compiles it to |.mps| files.
It also allows for various configuration options
to manage the generation of files and compilation.

\section{Introduction}

\MP{} is a versatile tool
to generate vector graphics files
from a plain text source for inclusion
in \LaTeX{} documents which allows to typeset labels
in native \LaTeX{} code and fonts.
The \MP{} compiler |mpost| typically compiles a
metapost source file (extension |.mp|) to
a set of metapost figure files (extension |.mps|)
which are encapsulated postscript files (|.eps|)
with a somewhat reduced scope.
The figure files can be included in a \LaTeX{}
document by |\includegraphics|,
and modern \TeX{} distributions are typically able to handle
the required conversions on the fly.

While many steps in the compilation process are automated,
some management is left to the user:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Link the figures in the metapost source
with the \LaTeX{} source by choosing an
appropriate figure filename (or numeric identifier).
\item
When a figure is changed,
the metapost source file must be compiled
to update the figure files,
and afterwards the \LaTeX{} source must be compiled
to introduce the changes into the output document.
\item
Keep any changes aligned between \LaTeX{}
and metapost source files.
\item
Set up a proper \LaTeX{} document structure
to compile labels via \LaTeX{}.
\item
Distribute source and figures as separate files.
\end{itemize}
%
The present \LaTeX{} package \ctanpkg{mpostinl}
helps in the management of metapost figures
by embedding them into the \LaTeX{} source:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
Figures are displayed at the location of their definition
within the \LaTeX{} source
to facilitate alignment between text and figures.
\item
A metapost source file with \LaTeX{} structure
for the labels is generated.
\item
Figure files are compiled automatically
from within the \LaTeX{} compiler.
\end{itemize}
%
For example, a simple figure consisting
of a circle might be represented as:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{mpostfig}
  draw fullcircle scaled 1cm;
  \end{mpostfig}
\end{verbatim}
%
The package also offers several options and customisations
to streamline its use in several situations:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
Figures can be assigned labels or filenames for later usage.
\item
There are several options and mechanisms to
minimise the need for multiple compiler passes
to generate the desired output.
\item
The package can handle several metapost files in a row
with common definitions or include files.
\item
The font generation, \LaTeX{} structure
and generated filenames can be customised.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Related CTAN Packages}

There are at least four other \LaTeX{} packages
which offer a similar functionality:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
The package \ctanpkg{emp}
provides similar basic functionality to compose a metapost file,
but it does not automatically compile it.
Analogously to the |picture| environment
the size for every figure must be specified explicitly.
\item
The package \href{http://ci.uofl.edu/tom/software/LaTeX/}{\markpkg{mpfig}}
by Tomasz Cholewo (not available on CTAN)
provides very basic functionality to compose a metapost file.
\item
The package \ctanpkg{mpgraphics}
provides similar functionality to compose and compile a metapost file.
It processes all figures immediately and does not offer labels
for recycling figures.
\item
The package \ctanpkg{gmp}
provides similar functionality to compose and compile a metapost file.
It processes all figures immediately and allows to inject \LaTeX{}
definitions into the metapost code at the price of
modifying the metapost syntax slightly.
\end{itemize}
%
The philosophy of the present package is to generate a
single metapost file containing all figures
as in a traditional metapost setup
which can be compiled in one pass.
The aim is to provide a metapost setup which works
with as little configuration as possible,
but which offers several configuration options to
customise the management in the desired way.
The package offers most of the functionality of the above packages,
but (presently) misses out on some more advanced features,
see \secref{sec:suggestions}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Usage}

This manual assumes familiarity
with the \MP{} figure description language.
The \MP{} manual is a recommended introduction
and an excellent reference.

To use the package \ctanpkg{mpostinl} add the command
\begin{center}
|\usepackage{mpostinl}|
\end{center}
to the preamble of your \LaTeX{} document.
If not yet present,
the package \ctanpkg{graphicx} will be loaded automatically.
Metapost figures and definitions are to be specified using
the environments |mpostfig| and |mpostdef|, respectively,
as described in \secref{sec:figuresdefinitions}.

The package collects the figure files
contained in the \LaTeX{} source,
writes them to a metapost file,
and compiles them at the end of the \LaTeX{} document.
This means that the figures (or their updates)
will normally \emph{not} be available
in the first \LaTeX{} run and a secondary run is required
for the correct output,
see \secref{sec:immediate} for strategies
to avoid a second pass.

You should make sure that \LaTeX{} allows
calling of external programs.
If this feature is not enabled by default,
it is achieved by calling |latex|
with the command line option |-shell-escape|
(or |-shell-restricted| if |mpost|
is in the list of permissible commands):
\begin{center}
|latex -shell-escape |\textit{source}
\end{center}
In the MiK\TeX{} distribution the appropriate
command line option is |-enable-write18|.
In a \LaTeX{} front end this option may
be configurable in the preferences.
If the shell escape is not available,
the generated metapost file(s) \textit{filename}
(typically the same as the \LaTeX{} source \textit{source})
must be compiled manually:
\begin{center}
|mpost -tex=latex |\textit{filename}
\end{center}

Some extended configuration options and situations are described in
the following sections:
package options are listed in \secref{sec:packageoptions};
some options for writing and compiling are discussed
in \secref{sec:compiling};
the generation of multiple metapost files
is described in \secref{sec:multiplefiles};
finally, some issues regarding other \LaTeX{} packages
are discussed in \secref{sec:interactions}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Figures and Definitions}
\label{sec:figuresdefinitions}

\DescribeEnv{mpostfig}
The main functionality provided
by the package is the |mpostfig| environment:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
|\||begin{mpostfig}[|\textit{opts}|]|\\
|  |\textit{metapost code}\\
|\||end{mpostfig}|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The above block is translated
to the following code in the metapost file:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
|filenametemplate:="|\textit{filename}|";|\\
|beginfig(|\textit{number}|)|\\
|  |\textit{metapost code}\\
|endfig;|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The optional argument \textit{opts} of the |mpostfig| environment
is a comma-separated list of options:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item |show|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Show the figure in place.
If neither |file| nor |label| are specified,
this option is forced to |true|.

\item |file=|\textit{filename} --
Filename for the figure.

\item |label=|\textit{label} --
Label for later use by the command |\mpostuse{|\textit{label}|}|.

\item |opt=|\textit{opt} --
Options to be passed on to |\includegraphics[|\textit{opt}|]|.

\item |now|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, overrides global setting |nowall|) --
Compile figure immediately. Requires global option |now| to work.

\item |twice|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, overrides global setting |twice|) --
Compile this figure twice.

\end{itemize}
%
Please note the following restrictions
due to the implementation via the package \ctanpkg{verbatim}:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
The closing statement |\||end{mpostfig}| must be on a line on its own.
Any amount of leading whitespace is allowed,
and trailing characters are ignored.

\item
The opening statement |\||begin{mpostfig}| has to find out
whether an optional argument is provided
by scanning into the block of metapost content.
If none is given, all the code already scanned needs to be
(re)interpreted as metapost content.
In special circumstances this may cause problems.
It should then help to use an empty optional argument:
|\||begin{mpostfig}[]|.

\item
Lines starting with a single `|%|'
are ignored and do not appear in the metapost file.
Double `|%%|'
or leading spaces preserve comments in the metapost file.

\item
The environment |mpostfig|
cannot be used within macro arguments or particular other environments
such as |align|, |gather|, |multline|, |equations| and |\<...\>|
of \ctanpkg{amsmath} and \ctanpkg{eqnlines}
(in certain situations |equation| and |\[...\]|
may be problematic as well).
If you want to display a figure in these situations,
you should declare the figure with a label and
display it via the command |\mpostuse| (see below).

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DescribeMacro{\mpostuse}
Figures which have been previously declared
with a label \textit{label}
can be recycled any number of times with the command:
\begin{center}
|\mpostuse[|\textit{opts}|]{|\textit{label}|}|
\end{center}
The options are passed on to
|\includegraphics[|\textit{opt}|]{|\textit{filename}|}|.
Note that |\mpostuse| accepts the overlay specification
from the \ctanpkg{beamer} package
\begin{center}
|\mpostuse<|\textit{overlay}|>[|\textit{opts}|]{|\textit{label}|}|
\end{center}
and passes it on to |\includegraphics|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DescribeMacro{\mpostgetname}
Furthermore, the filename of a figure can be obtained by
calling |\mpostgetname{|\textit{label}|}|.
The filename is returned in the macro |\mpostfigurename|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DescribeEnv{mpostdef}
Plain metapost code which is not part of a figure
(definitions, assignments)
can be specified by the |mpostdef| environment:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
|\||begin{mpostdef}[|\textit{opts}|]|\\
|  |\textit{code}\\
|\||end{mpostdef}|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
Note that the same restrictions as for |mpostfig| (see above)
apply to |mpostdef|.
The optional argument \textit{opts}
is a comma-separated list of options:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item |global|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, overrides global setting |globaldef|) --
In a setup with multiple metapost files, the block \textit{code}
is applied to all files, not just the current file.

\item |tex|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
The block \textit{code} represents \TeX{} or \LaTeX{} definitions
rather than \MP{} code,
which will be enclosed in the metapost file by |verbatimtex| and |etex|.
This feature is superseded by the environment |mposttex| described below.
The |tex| option is deprecated, and provided for backward compatibility only.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DescribeEnv{mposttex}
\TeX{} or \LaTeX{} definitions for use in metapost labels
can be specified by the |mposttex| environment:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
|\||begin{mposttex}[|\textit{opts}|]|\\
|  |\textit{code}\\
|\||end{mposttex}|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The code will be enclosed in the metapost file by |verbatimtex| and |etex|.
Note that the same restrictions as for |mpostfig| (see above)
apply to |mposttex|.
The optional argument \textit{opts}
is a comma-separated list of options:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item |global|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, overrides global setting |globaldef|) --
In a setup with multiple metapost files, the block \textit{code}
is applied to all files, not just the current file.

\item |dual|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
The definitions within the block \textit{code}
will be available to both metapost figures and subsequent \LaTeX{} code.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Package Options}
\label{sec:packageoptions}

\DescribeMacro{\mpostsetup}
Options can be passed to the package by:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
&|\usepackage[|\textit{opts}|]{mpostinl}|
\\
or&|\PassOptionsToPackage{|\textit{opts}|}{mpostinl}|
\\
or&|\mpostsetup{|\textit{opts}|}|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
|\PassOptionsToPackage| must be used before |\usepackage|;
|\mpostsetup| must be used afterwards (for selected options).
\textit{opts} is a comma-separated list of options.
Below we provide a complete list of available options
while some of the more relevant options are discussed
in detail in the following sections:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item |draft|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable |draft| mode by declaring |draft:=1|
at the top of the metapost file.

\item |final| --
Same as |draft=false|.

\item |write|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |true|) --
Enable/disable writing to metapost file.

\item |compile|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |true|) --
Enable/disable automatic compilation of metapost file.
Requires shell escapes to work properly.

\item |twice|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable secondary metapost compilation.
Some metapost files may require this to produce the intended output.

\item |clean|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |true|) --
Enable/disable cleaning of figure files prior to compilation.
A dummy figure will be shown in case metapost cannot generate a figure.

\item |checksum|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable update detection.
Compiles figures only if the metapost code has changed.

\item |fonts|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable embedding of fonts in metapost figures
by setting |prologues:=3| thus making them proper
encapsulated postscript files.
This option may be required if figure files are
used outside a \TeX{} environment,
e.g.\ if the files are to be viewed or processed by |.eps| tools.
Has no effect if |prologues| option is specified.

\item |prologues=|\textit{value} --
Declares |prologues:=|\textit{value} at the top of the metapost file.
Set \textit{value} to empty to disable the |prologues| statement.

\item |lineno|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable line number indicators in the metapost file.
All blocks in the metapost file will start with the line number
where this block can be found in the \LaTeX{} source file.
To view the source file name
you should load the package \ctanpkg{currfile}.

\item |labelnames|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Use the figure label instead of a consecutive number
to construct the name for figure files.
The benefit of this mode is that the label will usually stay fixed
while the number may change when adding or removing figures.
The drawback is that the \LaTeX{} internal labels will appear as
part of the filenames cluttering the directory slightly more.
Moreover, one has to make sure that the figure labels
are valid filenames in your operating system,
i.e.\ use special characters with care,
better only use alphanumeric characters,
and bear in mind that some operating systems do
not distinguish upper- and lowercase letters.

\item |latex|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |true|) --
Switch between \TeX{} (|false|) and \LaTeX{} (|true|)
processing of labels.
In \LaTeX{} mode a basic \LaTeX{} document structure is
provided by the metapost file.

\item |compiler=|\textit{compiler} --
Set the compiler program for labels to \textit{compiler}
(command line option |-tex=|\textit{compiler} for \MP).
The default is |tex| (in \TeX{} mode)
or |latex| (in \LaTeX{} mode).
Set \textit{compiler} to empty to specify no compiler.

\item |format=|\textit{tag} --
Write format tag |%&|%
\textit{tag} to specify the compiler program for labels.
The default is |tex| (in \TeX{} mode)
or |latex| (in \LaTeX{} mode).
Set \textit{tag} to empty to write no format tag.

\item |class=|\textit{class}
(initially set to |article|) --
Set the document class to be used in \LaTeX{} mode.

\item |classopt=|\textit{options} --
Set the options for the |\documentclass| statement in \LaTeX{} mode,
e.g.\ |12pt| or |11pt|.
No options are specified initially resulting in the |10pt| font set.

\item |mem=|\textit{mem} --
Set the metapost format file to \textit{mem}.

\item |command=|\textit{command} --
Use \textit{command} to process the generated file(s).
By default the \MP{} program |mpost| is invoked
to compile the generated metapost files
(with appropriate command line options).

\item |now|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Activate/deactivate immediate mode.
In immediate mode, figures can be processed immediately
so that a secondary \LaTeX{} pass is not required to
display the figure correctly.
Note that this option merely enables recording
of all the required definitions
so that immediate processing will be possible,
but it does not activate immediate processing per se.

\item |nowall|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable immediate processing for all figures by default.
This option will call the \MP{} compiler for every figure.
While convenient, it requires heavier processing.

\item |nowkeep|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable immediate generation
of figures by individual metapost files.
If this mode is enabled,
the filename for immediate processing
of the figure \textit{filename}|.mps|
will be \textit{filename}|.mp|.
Otherwise the metapost code is stored in a temporary file and
is overwritten by any subsequent immediate processing.

\item |globaldef|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|) --
Enable/disable the |global| option
for the |mpostdef| and |mposttex| environments by default.
This option can be used to specify a global block of definitions
by enclosing it with appropriate |\mpostsetup| statements.

\item |template=|\textit{template}
(initially set to |\mpostfilename-#1.mps|) --
Set the template for figure filenames
for which it is not given explicitly.
The parameter |#1| carries the number (or label) to be used.
Moreover, the macro |\mpostfilename|
carries the current metapost file.

\item |extension=|\textit{ext}
(initially set to |mps|) --
Set the default extension for figure filenames.

\item |numberwithin=|\textit{counter} --
Declares the figure counter
to be a child of \textit{counter}.
In other words, the figure counter
is reset when \textit{counter} is increased,
and the figure number will be composed
as \textit{counter}|-|\textit{figure}.
Using this option with a top-level counter
such as |section| or |chapter|
stabilises the figure numbering
by making changes to the sequence have
effects only within the present section or chapter.

\item |beamer|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |true|) --
Enable/disable processing of overlay parameters |<|\ldots|>|
by |\mpostuse| defined by the \ctanpkg{beamer} package.

\item |warnunused|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |true|) --
Enable/disable warnings for unused figure labels.

\item |outputdir=|\textit{dir} --
Move all generated metapost figure files (|.mps|) to the directory \textit{dir}.
The directory will be created if it does not exist.
When displaying figures, the package will first check for files in \textit{dir},
and fall back to the current directory if not found.
This allows the same behavior as before:
on the first pass, a placeholder box with the file path is shown;
on the second pass, the actual figure is inserted.

\end{itemize}
%
Admittedly, some of these options are hardly necessary
as they will have little impact on output
or performance in ordinary situations.
They are provided for completeness,
to make the package work in more exotic situations,
and/or to satisfy some personal taste regarding
how things should be managed.

\DescribeMacro{\mpostplaceholder}
\DescribeMacro{\mpostdisplaylabel}
Finally, the package allows to customise the placeholder
which is displayed when a figure file is not (yet) present
after the first \LaTeX{} pass (or in case of some compile error)
or a figure label does not exist.
In these situations the following macro is called:
\begin{center}
|\mpostplaceholder[|\textit{type}|]{|\textit{name}|}|
\end{center}
\textit{type} is either `|file|' or `|label|'
and \textit{name} is the missing filename or label.
By default this command displays a 1''$\times$0.6'' box
containing the missing filename or label.
This behaviour can be customised by overwriting the macro.
It makes sense to display the filename or label through
|\mpostdisplaylabel| which can handle some special characters
such as an underscore.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Writing and Compiling Options}
\label{sec:compiling}

The following discusses some package options regarding the writing
and compiling of metapost files in more detail.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Label Typesetting Options.}

Metapost figure files may or may not include the \MF{} fonts
which are used by the figure labels.
When the generated metapost figures
are only used within a \LaTeX{} document
in a standard \TeX{} distribution, it is not necessary to
include the required fonts as they are automatically
supplied by the \LaTeX{} compiler.
This omission reduces the size of the figure files
(but apparently it has no impact
on the size of the compiled \LaTeX{} document
in modern \TeX{} distributions).
However, the postscript structure
of such figure files is incomplete,
and therefore the labels typically appear distorted
in external viewing or processing tools.
If the figure files are to be viewed,
processed or passed on to
a publisher, it makes sense to include the required fonts.
The latter is achieved by enabling the package option |fonts|.
In this context, one can also set the default figure file
extension to |eps| by means of the package option |extension|.

By default, the package provides a \LaTeX{} document structure
for processing labels by \LaTeX{}.
The default document class is |article| without options.
An alternative class and options can be specified
by the package options |class| and |classopt|.
Further packages or macros should be declared as usual
by specifying them in a |mposttex| enviroment.
If no \LaTeX{} structure is desired,
set the package option |latex| to |false|.
If the typesetting requires an advanced compiler
beyond |latex| or |tex|, it should be
specified by the package option |compiler|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Compiling Options.}

When the figure files are in a final form
it may make sense to disable the cleaning, compiling
or even the writing of the metapost file(s)
by setting the package options |compile|, |clean|
or |write| to |false|.
In particular, this may be desirable
if the \LaTeX{} source is uploaded to a repository
or passed on to a publisher.

The package can check whether the generated files
change with respect to the previous \LaTeX{} pass,
and only modified files are compiled thereupon.
This check can be enabled by setting the option
|checksum| to |true|.
Note that under some conditions
(in particular, if the previous \LaTeX{} pass
produced compile errors),
figures may not get compiled even though the source changed.
In that case you can trigger compilation
by deleting the generated metapost source or figures
or by introducing further changes to the metapost code.
By default all files are compiled.

When the metapost file compiles with errors,
one can inspect the generated metapost file.
To this end it may be helpful to know which
part of the \LaTeX{} source file is responsible
for which part of the metapost file.
The package option |lineno| activates
prepending every block in the metapost file
by the corresponding location in the \LaTeX{} source.
If the \LaTeX{} source is distributed over several files,
the source filename can also be provided
if the package \ctanpkg{currfile} is loaded.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Filename Options.}

By default the names of figure files take the form
%
\begin{center}
\textit{filename}|-|\textit{specifier}|.|\textit{ext}
\end{center}
where \textit{filename} is the name of the metapost file,
\textit{specifier} is an integer number which enumerates the figures
and \textit{ext} is `|mps|'.
There are several options to customise the scheme:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
The figure option |file| allows to explicitly specify
the desired filename.

\item
The package option |numberwithin=|\textit{section} can be used to
associate the counting with a top-level section counter
(such as `|section|' or `|chapter|').
Then \textit{specifier} takes the form
\textit{section}|-|\textit{number},
where \textit{number} is an integer that enumerates the figures
within the present \textit{section}.

\item
The package option |labelnames| lets \textit{specifier}
be the figure label. This option should be used with care,
as the operating system does not necessarily allow
or distinguish all characters which are available for \TeX{} macros.

\item
The extension \textit{ext} can be customised
by the package option |extension|.

\item
The package option |template|
allows to customise the above template.
In composing the template,
the argument |#1| carries the \textit{specifier}
and |\mpostfilename| carries the name
of the present metapost file.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Multiple Files}
\label{sec:multiplefiles}

By default the package \ctanpkg{mpostinl} writes out a single file
\textit{source}|.mp| if the \LaTeX{} source is called \textit{source}|.tex|.
However, the package can also be configured
to write out several metapost files.
This feature can be used to declare one metapost file
for each top-level section of a large \LaTeX{} document
(e.g.\ section or chapter).
Alternatively, one could define
different metapost files for figures of different kinds
(e.g.\ technical drawings, diagrams, graphs, charts).
Note that these could well use different
sets of metapost macros and variables.

This feature can make sense
if the metapost source or generated figures
are to be passed on to someone else (e.g.\ publisher)
in order to help clarify the placement of figures.
It may also be useful if selected sections
of the document are generated
individually by means of |\includeonly|,
in which case only the relevant metapost file
is generated and compiled.

The contents of each metapost file should be enclosed
by |\mpostfile| and |\mpostdone|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DescribeMacro{\mpostfile}
A new metapost file is started by the command:
\begin{center}
|\mpostfile[|\textit{opts}|]{|\textit{filename}|}|
\end{center}
%
\textit{filename} is the filename without |.mp| extension.
\textit{opt} is a comma-separated list of options:
the only available option is |include|[|=true|\textbar|false|]
(no value implies |true|, initially set to |false|)
which declares whether the file is an include file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DescribeMacro{\mpostdone}
The present metapost file is completed by the command
|\mpostdone| which also compiles the contained figures.
Note that this command is called automatically
at the end of the \LaTeX{} document.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Global Definitions.}

Definitions in |mpostdef| and |mposttex| environments apply to the
present metapost file only. However, definitions can also be
specified for all metapost files
by means of the option |global|:
\begin{center}
|\||begin{mpostdef}[global]|
\end{center}
These definitions are stored internally and will be written
to all subsequent metapost files.

To declare several consecutive (or all)
blocks of definitions as global,
one can use the package option |globaldef|.
To that end, enclose the blocks by
|\mpostsetup{globaldef=true}| and |\mpostsetup{globaldef=false}|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Include Files.}

Alternatively, global definitions can be saved to an include file.
This may make sense if there is a large amount of definitions
which should not be written to each and every metapost file.
An include file is declared by
|\mpostfile[include]{|\textit{filename}|}|
and will be used by all subsequent main metapost files.
Include files are equivalent to global definitions,
but they cannot contain \TeX{} definitions.
Moreover they must not contain figures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Immediate Processing}
\label{sec:immediate}

By default, the metapost file is compiled
at the end of the \LaTeX{} document.
Therefore all new figures and any changes to existing figures
are not reflected in the compiled \LaTeX{} document
after the first pass.
A second \LaTeX{} pass is needed to generate the desired output.
Moreover, any change to the sequence of figures
(figures inserted, deleted or moved)
can only be seen after the second pass;
the first pass shows the old sequence.

In the following we present some strategies to minimise or avoid
this issue.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Collecting Figures at the Top.}

One option is to declare all figures
with labels near the top of the document,
and close the metapost file by the command |\mpostdone|.
The compiled figures are immediately available afterwards.
A side effect is that metapost
and \LaTeX{} source is necessarily separated
(which may be considered a benefit
or a drawback depending on philosophy).
Note that in a setup with multiple metapost files,
the figures can be defined at the top of each section
thereby allowing some association between figures and manuscript.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Stable Filenames.}

A change of figure sequence can have irritating effects
because some figures are displayed
in the wrong place in the first pass.
Even though a second pass resolves this issue,
the first pass may have upset the page composition
so that some labels containing page numbers can be messed up
in the second pass thus requiring a third pass.
There are some methods to reduce this effect:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Provide a filename for each figure by the option |file|.

\item
Automatically align the figure filenames with the labels by
the package option |labelnames|.

\item
Use the package option |numberwithin| with the counter
of the top-level section.
Changes of the figure order will then
be contained within each section.

\item
Use one metapost file for each top-level section.
Changes of the figure order will then
be contained within each metapost file.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Immediate Processing.}

The above strategies are workarounds, but the package also provides
a mechanism to compile individual figures or all figures at once.
The drawback is that one metapost file with all relevant definitions
needs to be generated and compiled for each figure.
This may have some negative impact on performance
for very large documents with excessively many figures,
if many such documents are to be generated in a row,
if the computer is slow or busy otherwise,
or if the laptop battery is low on a long journey
(or eventually if the user is old-fashioned or paranoid).

The mechanism is enabled by the package option |now|.
While composing or editing individual figures,
one can specify the figure option |now|,
and remove it when the figure is final.
Alternatively one can activate immediate processing for all figures
with the package option |nowall| (together with |now|).
Ordinarily, a temporary file is used for the metapost source
for immediate processing.
If the metapost sources for individual figures are needed,
the package option |nowkeep| stores the metapost source
for every generated figure \textit{filename}|.mps|
in the file \textit{filename}|.mp|.
When the figures are in a final state,
all immediate processing can be disabled by turning off the package
option |now|.

Note that changing some variables within the figure blocks
can have undesired effects for immediate processing:
In immediate processing only the present figure is included
in the metapost file,
otherwise the metapost file contains the sequence of all figures.
Therefore, a change or (re)definition of a variable within
a figure block will not be visible to all subsequent figures
in immediate mode!
To avoid such situations:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
Do not (re)define variables within a figure block.
Use a definition block before the figure instead.
\item
Provide an initial value for all used variables
which could change within other figures.
\item
For internal variables (such as the size |ahlength| of an arrow head)
you can |save| the initial value before
the first redefinition within a figure block.
Alternatively you can prepend the first change to the variable
by |interim|.
Note that you can declare variables as internal
by means of |newinternal|.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interaction with Other Packages}
\label{sec:interactions}

The following lists some potential issues in
the interaction with other \LaTeX{} packages:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Package \markpkg{inputenc}.}

This package should not interfere with the input encoding
selected via the package \ctanpkg{inputenc}, e.g.\ |utf8| encoding.
Extended characters are passed on
unchanged by the |mpostfig| environment.
If you declare an input encoding for your \LaTeX{} source by:
\begin{center}
|\usepackage[|\textit{enc}|]{inputenc}|
\end{center}
you should select the \emph{same} input encoding for the labels
in the metapost figures by means of:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
|\||begin{mposttex}|\\
|\usepackage[|\textit{enc}|]{inputenc}|\\
|\||end{mposttex}|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Package \markpkg{beamer}.}

The package \ctanpkg{beamer} is a popular package for
preparing slideshow presentations.
In particular, slides can be presented in several steps
by means on an overlay mechanism.
To that end the |frame| environment
saves the enclosed block and processes it in several passes.
Therefore, the environments |mpostfig|, |mpostdef| and |mposttex|
must not be used within the |frame| environment.
Instead, figures should be declared outside the |frame| environment
and can be displayed by |\mpostuse| within the |frame| environment.
Note that |\mpostuse| accepts the overlay parameter |<|\ldots|>|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Package \markpkg{graphbox}.}

Figures are eventually displayed by the |\includegraphics| command
which aligns the graphics with the bottom of the current line.
To achieve different alignments or placements takes some efforts.
The package \ctanpkg{graphbox} extends the optional
arguments of |\includegraphics| to customise the alignment conveniently.
Since graphics arguments are passed on directly to |\includegraphics|
the \ctanpkg{graphbox} package can be used without restrictions.
For instance, to align a figure vertically with the centre of the line,
you may use |\||begin{mpostfig}[opt={align}]|
or |\mpostuse[align]{|\textit{label}|}|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Package \markpkg{latexmp}.}

The \MP{} package \ctanpkg{latexmp} writes its own \LaTeX{} structure
to the metapost file.
Therefore \ctanpkg{mpostinl} must not write the \LaTeX{} structure,
but still use the |latex| compiler.
Furthermore \ctanpkg{latexmp} needs two \MP{} passes.
The required options are:
\begin{center}
|\mpostsetup{latex=false,format,compiler=latex,twice}|
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Script \markpkg{mplatex}.}

The \MP{} processing script \ctanpkg{mplatex} expects the default metapost
file naming convention (\textit{filename}|.|\textit{nn})
and no |prologues| statement.
Moreover, it provides the \LaTeX{} structure.
The required options are:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
|\mpostsetup{latex=false,format,prologues}|\\
|\mpostsetup{template={\mpostfilename.#1}}|\\
|\mpostsetup{command={mplatex |\textit{opt}|}}|
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
In \textit{opt} you can specify command line options for |mplatex|,
e.g.\ to include \LaTeX{} packages.
Make sure to enable full access to external programs,
and that |mplatex| is in the path (or specify its location explicitly).
Note that the file naming convention (\textit{filename}|.|\textit{nn})
does not seem to work with pdf\LaTeX{}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Packages \markpkg{amsmath}, \markpkg{eqnlines}.}

The packages \ctanpkg{amsmath} and \ctanpkg{eqnlines}
declare several math display environments
(|align|, |gather|, |multline|, |equations|, |\<...\>|;
potentially also |equation| and |\[...\]|)
which scan the contents before typesetting them as mathematical expressions.
The scanning process eliminates line breaks in the source code
and thus breaks the scanning for the end of the metapost code block
which has to be on a separate line.
Furthermore, other aspects of the metapost code may get distorted,
so no attempts are made to recover.
Please declare the metapost figures outside of math display environments
and print then via |\mpostuse|.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Run (pdf)\LaTeX{} on |mpostinl.dtx|
to compile the manual |mpostinl.pdf| (this file).

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Required Packages and Software}

The package relies on other packages and software:
\begin{itemize}
\item
This package relies on some functionality of the package \ctanpkg{verbatim}
to read verbatim code from the \LaTeX{} source without expansion of macros.
Compatibility with the \ctanpkg{verbatim} package
has been tested with v1.5q (2014/10/28).
\item
This package uses the package \ctanpkg{graphicx}
from the \ctanpkg{graphics} bundle to include graphics files.
Compatibility with the \ctanpkg{graphicx} package
has been tested with v1.0g (2014/10/28).
\item
This package uses the package \ctanpkg{keyval}
from the \ctanpkg{graphics} bundle
to process the options for the package, environments and macros.
Compatibility with the \ctanpkg{keyval} package
has been tested with v1.15 (2014/10/28).
\item
This package uses the package \ctanpkg{shellesc}
to invoke |mpost|.
Compatibility with the \ctanpkg{shellesc} package
has been tested with v1.0d (2023/07/08).
\item
This package uses the command |\currfilename|
provided by the package \ctanpkg{currfile} (if available and loaded)
to indicate the \LaTeX{} source file in the generated metapost file.
Compatibility with the \ctanpkg{currfile} package
has been tested with v0.7c (2015/04/23).
\item
The package assumes a \TeX{} installation with \MP{}
configured appropriately.
Recent \textsf{texlive} and MiK\TeX{} distributions should work well.
Compatibility with the \textsf{texlive} distribution
has been tested with the 2016 issue containing
pdf\TeX{} version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17
and \MP{} version 1.9991.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Feature Suggestions}
\label{sec:suggestions}

The following is a list of features which may be useful for future
versions of this package:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
A method to expand \LaTeX{} macros to the metapost code
to match the corresponding feature of package \ctanpkg{gmp}:
One difficulty is that direct insertion of \LaTeX{} macros
requires a substantially different implementation of the
block scanning method
because the method supplied by \ctanpkg{verbatim} does not work.
Furthermore, some escape mechanism is required
either to expand selected \LaTeX{} macros
or to prevent their expansion (within |btex| \ldots\ |etex| blocks).
%  encapsulate via | |
%  extra env
\item
A simpler approach to the above feature would be to implement a
command or option to prepend some metapost statements
to a given metapost block where \LaTeX{} macros are expanded.
This may work well for passing very few macros to metapost variables.
However, one would have to decide how aggressively
macros are to be expanded.
\item
Write generated files to a subdirectory
or remove files not needed after processing.
However, both appear to be somewhat in contrast
to the usual \TeX{} philosophy.
%\item
%improve detection of changed figure files?
%allow to declare extra include files for update detection
%clean default to false?
\end{itemize}

% In this section we provide a \LaTeX{} example how to use
% some of the \ctanpkg{mpostinl} features.
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Preamble}
%
% Standard document class:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Adjust the paragraph shape:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\parindent0pt
\parskip6pt
%    \end{macrocode}

% Include the \ctanpkg{mpostinl} package,
% include \MF{} fonts in the metapost figures:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\usepackage[fonts=true]{mpostinl}
%    \end{macrocode}

% We will test labels in UTF-8, so include package \ctanpkg{inputenc}:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Include packages \ctanpkg{currfile} and \ctanpkg{graphbox} if available,
% declare dummy option |align| for |\includegraphics|
% if \ctanpkg{graphbox} is not available:
%    \begin{macrocode}
%% optional: add filename to position labels in metapost code

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Basic Functionality}
%
% We start by demonstrating the basic functionality of the package:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\section{Basic Functionality}
%    \end{macrocode}

% First, draw a circle of diameter 1cm and write a `1' in the centre:
%    \begin{macrocode}
a plain circle:\\
\begin{mpostfig}
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 1 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Use the options for |\includegraphics|.
% Draw another circle containing a `2' and scale it by factor $1.5$.
% Also vertically align to the centre (if \ctanpkg{graphbox} is available):
%    \begin{macrocode}
scaled (and aligned to centre if available):\\
X
\begin{mpostfig}[opt={scale=1.5,align}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 2 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
X
%    \end{macrocode}

% Declare a figure with label |fig|, do not show:
%    \begin{macrocode}
declare figure with label (no display).
\begin{mpostfig}[label={fig}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 3 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display the figure:
%    \begin{macrocode}
display:\\
\mpostuse{fig}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display the figure with options for |\includegraphics|:
%    \begin{macrocode}
display with options:\\
\mpostuse[scale=1.5,align]{fig}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display the figure within a box:
%    \begin{macrocode}
display in a box:\\
\fbox{\mpostuse{fig}}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display the figure at the centre of a line:
%    \begin{macrocode}
centred display:
\begin{center}
\mpostuse[scale=1.5]{fig}
\end{center}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display the figure within an equation:
%    \begin{macrocode}
display in equation (align if possible):
\begin{equation}
\mpostuse[scale=1.5,align]{fig}
\end{equation}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Show the filename of the figure:
%    \begin{macrocode}
filename: \mpostgetname{fig}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Declare a figure with filename, label and show it,
% then display filename:
%    \begin{macrocode}
figure with filename:\\
\begin{mpostfig}[file={\jobname-name.mps},label={name},show]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 4 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{name}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display the file via |\includegraphics|.
% As the figure may not exist (in the first pass)
% check for existence first to avoid a compile error:
%    \begin{macrocode}
display by \verb+\includegraphics+ (if file exists):\\
\IfFileExists{\jobname-name.mps}{\includegraphics{\jobname-name.mps}}{}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Show a figure which does not exist,
% triggers a warning and displays a box:
%    \begin{macrocode}
label does not exist:\\
\mpostuse{not_exist}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Display a figure with a label containing special characters in UTF-8.
% Note that the internal variable |unit| is changed locally (|interim|)
% so that subsequent figures will see the old value:
%    \begin{macrocode}

% \subsection{Immediate Processing}
%
% Next, we demonstrate immediate processing
% (make sure to enable the package option |now|):
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\section{Immediate Processing}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Declare a figure for immediate processing.
% You may change the size |unit| and the figure will be
% adjusted after the first \LaTeX{} pass:
%    \begin{macrocode}
immediate processing per figure:\\
\begin{mpostfig}[now]
interim unit:=1.5cm;
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 5 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
%    \end{macrocode}

% One can also enable immediate processing for all subsequent figures.
% Furthermore, store the metapost source in individual files:
%    \begin{macrocode}
turn on immediate processing for all figures and keep sources.
\mpostsetup{nowall,nowkeep}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Now declare a figure with individual metapost source,
% display via |\includegraphics|,
% and confirm that source exists:
%    \begin{macrocode}
generate file \texttt{\jobname-now.mps}:
\begin{mpostfig}[file={\jobname-now.mps}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 6 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
display by \verb+\includegraphics+:\\
\includegraphics{\jobname-now.mps}
\\
source \texttt{\jobname-now.mp}
\IfFileExists{\jobname-now.mp}{exists}{does not exist}.
%    \end{macrocode}

% Reset immediate processing options for further examples
% (normally not necessary):
%    \begin{macrocode}
turn off immediate processing and discard sources.
\mpostsetup{nowall=false,nowkeep=false}
%    \end{macrocode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Filename Composition}
%
% Now, we demonstrate how to adjust the composition of figure filenames:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\section{Filename Composition}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Use the figure label instead of a figure counter:
%    \begin{macrocode}
by label:\\
\mpostsetup{labelnames=true}
\begin{mpostfig}[label={circle},show]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 7 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\mpostsetup{labelnames=false}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{circle}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Change extension to |.eps|:
%    \begin{macrocode}
change extension:
\mpostsetup{extension=eps}
\begin{mpostfig}[label={ext}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 8 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\mpostsetup{extension=mps}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{ext}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Change template altogether:
%    \begin{macrocode}
change template:\\
\mpostsetup{template=\mpostfilename-figure-#1.mps}
\begin{mpostfig}[label={template},show]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 9 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\mpostsetup{template=\mpostfilename-#1.mps}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{template}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Demonstrate numbering within a section (here: |subsection|)
%    \begin{macrocode}
\mpostsetup{numberwithin=subsection}
%    \end{macrocode}

% One figure in the first section:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\subsection{Section 1}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec1}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 10 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec1}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Two figures in the second section:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\subsection{Section 2}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec2}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 11 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec2}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec3}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 12 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec3}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% One figure in the third section:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\subsection{Section 3}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec4}]
draw fullcircle scaled unit;
label(btex 13 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec4}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Reset numbering for further examples
% (normally not necessary, setting cannot be undone completely):
%    \begin{macrocode}
\makeatletter
\def\thempi@count{\arabic{mpi@count}}
\makeatother
%    \end{macrocode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Multiple Files}
%
% Finally, demonstrate the generation and usage of several metapost files:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\section{Multiple Files}
%    \end{macrocode}

% First, close the old metapost file to get to a clean state:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\mpostdone
%    \end{macrocode}

% Make a definition which will apply to all metapost files.
% |global| option can be activated
% for a block of definitions (here only one):
%    \begin{macrocode}
\mpostsetup{globaldef=true}

\begin{mpostdef}
unit:=0.8cm;
\end{mpostdef}

\mpostsetup{globaldef=false}
%    \end{macrocode}

% Alternatively, we can define an include file
% to be included by all main metapost files.
% This has the same effect as a global definition,
% but is intended for long definitions:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\mpostfile[include]{\jobname-inc}

\begin{mpostdef}
def drawcircle =
draw fullcircle scaled unit
enddef;
\end{mpostdef}

\mpostdone
%    \end{macrocode}

% The first file contains one figure:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\subsection*{Section 1}
\mpostfile{\jobname-sec1}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec5}]
drawcircle;
label(btex 14 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec5}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}

\mpostdone
%    \end{macrocode}

% The second file contains a local redefinition of |unit|
% and two figures:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\subsection*{Section 2}
\mpostfile{\jobname-sec2}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec6}]
drawcircle;
label(btex 15 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec6}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}

\begin{mpostdef}
unit:=1.5cm;
\end{mpostdef}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec7}]
drawcircle;
label(btex 16 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec7}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}

\mpostdone
%    \end{macrocode}

% The third file contains one figure. Note that the redefinition
% of the second file does not apply here:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\subsection*{Section 3}
\mpostfile{\jobname-sec3}

\begin{mpostfig}[show,label={sec8}]
drawcircle;
label(btex 17 etex, (0,0));
\end{mpostfig}
\\
filename: \mpostgetname{sec8}
\texttt{\mpostfigurename}

\mpostdone
